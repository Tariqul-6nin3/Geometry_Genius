          Q.1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?

            <strong>Definiton Of DOM:</strong> The Document Object Model (DOM)
            is a programming interface that allows web developers to manipulate
            the content and structure of web pages using scripting languages
            such as JavaScript. It provides a hierarchical representation of the
            web page, and developers can use this representation to access and
            modify the elements of the page dynamically. The DOM is essential
            for creating interactive and dynamic web pages and is widely used in
            web development. <br />
            The DOM provides a set of standard methods and properties that can
            be used to access, manipulate, and update the content and structure
            of web pages. For example, with the DOM, developers can add, delete,
            or modify elements on the page, change the style or content of
            elements, and respond to user actions like clicks and key presses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Purposes of DOM: </strong> The main purpose of the Document
            Object Model (DOM) is to provide a way for web developers to
            programmatically manipulate the content and structure of web pages.
            Some common use cases of the DOM include:

            <li>
              Accessing and modifying HTML elements: The DOM allows developers
              to access HTML elements on a web page and modify their properties,
              such as their content, style, or attributes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding or removing HTML elements: Developers can use the DOM to
              dynamically add or remove HTML elements from a web page, allowing
              them to create dynamic and interactive content.
            </li>
            <li>
              Responding to user events: The DOM enables developers to respond
              to user events, such as clicks or key presses, by modifying the
              content or behavior of the web page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Validating form data: Web forms can be validated using the DOM,
              allowing developers to ensure that user input is in the correct
              format and meets specific requirements
            </li>
          </p>

          Q.2: How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM
          methods?
        </h4>
        <div class="ml-4 bg-yellow-50 p-4">
          <p>
            To select HTML elements using the Document Object Model (DOM), we
            can use a variety of methods depending on the specific elements we
            want to select. <br />
            Methods of DOM are given below:
            <li>
              getElementById(): This method returns the element with the
              specified ID attribute.
            </li>
            <li>
              getElementsByClassName(): This method returns a collection of
              elements that have a specific class name.
            </li>
            <li>
              getElementsByTagName(): This method returns a collection of
              elements that have a specific tag name.
            </li>
            <li>
              querySelector(): This method returns the first element that
              matches a specified CSS selector
            </li>
            <li>
              querySelectorAll(): This method returns a collection of all
              elements that match a specified CSS selector.
            </li>
          </p>

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold mt-2">Q.3: What is event bubble?</h4>
      </div>
      <div class="ml-4 bg-teal-50 p-4">
        <p>
          <strong>Definition of Event Bubble:</strong> Event bubbling is a
          behavior in which an event that is triggered on a specific HTML
          element is also propagated to and processed by its parent and ancestor
          elements in the DOM tree. This means that when an event is triggered,
          it is first handled by the element where it originated and then passed
          up the DOM tree until it reaches the root document object. Event
          bubbling is important in web development because it allows developers
          to create more modular and reusable code by attaching event listeners
          to parent elements rather than individual child elements. However, it
          can also lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues if not
          managed properly.

          Q.4: What is a callback function and why will you use it?
        </h4>
      </div>
      <div class="ml-4 bg-slate-100 p-4">
        <p>
          <strong>Definition Of Callback function:</strong> A callback function
          is a type of function in programming that is defined separately from
          the function in which it is used. The main function can then call the
          callback function at specific points during its execution, passing it
          as an argument to achieve a particular task. The callback function is
          usually used to execute some code after the main function has
          completed a specific task, or when a certain event occurs. For
          example, a callback function can be used to handle user input or to
          perform an action once a long-running operation has completed.
          Callback functions are a common programming pattern in many languages
          and frameworks, and they are especially useful in situations where the
          order of execution is not known ahead of time, or when multiple
          functions need to be executed in parallel or in sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reason behind using Callback function:</strong> Callback
          functions are used to handle situations where a function needs to wait
          for an operation to complete before it can continue executing. By
          passing a callback function as an argument to the function, the
          callback can be called when the operation is complete, allowing the
          main function to continue executing. Callbacks are also useful for
          handling user events or input, and are a powerful tool for creating
          flexible and modular code.
